# Creedengo-Infra

_creedengo_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.
